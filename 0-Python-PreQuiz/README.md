# Python & CS Pre-Quiz


---

This quiz asks a variety of CS & Python related questions. These are pretty basic. Students who've already taken a CS class will likely get some right, and will likely get some wrong. Students can probably answer most of them if they do well in the first semester. If a student does well on this at the start of the year, they'll likely have an advantage, but there is still plenty for them to learn.

If a student thinks they've already mastered the content before the year's even begun, the practice Python Certification Exam would be a better indicator.
